Publication Request for CVE-2021-24119

CVEID:          CVE-2021-24119
PRODUCT:        Mbed TLS
VERSION:        Fixed in 2.26.0
PROBLEM TYPE:   Side-Channel Vulnerability in base64 decoding
DESCRIPTION:    Mbed TLS before the version 2.26.0 uses a non-constant time
                implementation for base64 decoding. Essentially, the usage of
                a lookup table in decoding keys stored as PEM files, allows an
                attacker to obtain key information by tracking the accessed
                cache lines during key decoding. The attack was demonstrated in
                Intel SGX.
                Mbed TLS fixed the issue in version 2.26.0. Please refer to:

Publication Request for CVE-2021-24117

CVEID:          CVE-2021-24117
PRODUCT:        Rust SGX
VERSION:        Vulnerable in v1.1.3
 
PROBLEM TYPE:   Side-Channel Vulnerability in base64 decoding
DESCRIPTION:    Rust SGX before and in the version v1.1.3 uses a non-constant time
                implementation for base64 decoding. Essentially, the usage of
                a lookup table in decoding keys stored as PEM files, allows an
                attacker to obtain key information by tracking the accessed
                cache lines during key decoding. The attack was demonstrated in
                Intel SGX.
                The issue is about to be fixed in the rust-base64 module:
